The aim of the project is to build a Machine Learning
Model to identify the most unengaged users in FinTech
industry to help them implement business actions to
convert them to engaged users.

The first step towards understanding engagement is
to establish a clear and robust definition of the metric.

Data Scientists need to build a metric that can help identify
engaged users and differentiate between engaged and unengaged users.
